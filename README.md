# Hello stranger 🙋‍♂️ 

I'm **Timo** and I love teaching machines how to solve problems.

## Setup

I'm using Windows. Yeah, you read that right. However, I feel at home in the WSL using the latest version of Ubuntu.  
I've accumulated a great hatred for mice (the electronics of course, I'm vegan 🌱). So, I'm using `neovim` and I'm absolutely loving it!

Consider following @ThePrimeagen and @tjdevries, they have great content about `neovim` (and plugins) on YouTube and Twitch.

My current setup can be found in this [.dotfiles](https://github.com/Chroma91/.dotfiles) repository.

## Latest Side Project

A CLI tool to manage your configuration and tools between multiple machines or when setting up something new.  
Of course, it's written in Rust 🦀, d'oh!  

Check it out here: [machine_setup](https://github.com/Chroma91/machine_setup).
